# Snake-Game
This Snake Game uses JavaScript and the Canvas API. The snake moves based on keyboard input, with each segment represented by an array. The game loop updates the snakeâ€™s position, detects collisions, and handles food consumption. It features score tracking and a reset function, allowing players to restart the game anytime.
